# Project Summary: Quiz Connect

**Quiz Connect** is a modern, full-stack web application designed for creating, sharing, and taking quizzes. It's built with a robust and scalable technology stack, featuring a React-based frontend and a Supabase backend. The application is feature-rich, with a strong emphasis on user interaction and community-driven content.

### Key Features:

*   **User Authentication and Profiles**: The application provides a complete authentication system, allowing users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. User profiles can include a bio, an avatar, and privacy settings, fostering a sense of identity and community.
*   **Comprehensive Quiz Creation**: Authenticated users can create detailed and interactive quizzes. The quiz editor allows for the configuration of titles, descriptions, categories, difficulty levels, time limits, and passing thresholds, providing a high degree of customization.
*   **Interactive Quiz-Taking Experience**: Users can browse and take quizzes created by others. The application tracks quiz attempts, scores, and the time taken, offering a dynamic and engaging experience for learners and quiz enthusiasts.
*   **Social and Community Features**: Quiz Connect includes a variety of social features to encourage user interaction. Users can follow each other, like their favorite quizzes, and leave comments, creating a vibrant and collaborative community around the content.
*   **Detailed Statistics and Analytics**: The application tracks and displays a wide range of statistics for both users and quizzes. User stats include the number of quizzes created and taken, average scores, and follower/following counts. Quiz stats cover metrics like the number of times a quiz has been played, its average score, and the number of likes it has received.
*   **Quiz Templates and Subscription Tiers**: The presence of a template library and pricing pages suggests that the application offers pre-built quiz templates to streamline the creation process. It also likely provides different subscription plans, which may unlock advanced features, premium content, or higher usage limits.

### Technology Stack:

*   **Frontend**: The application is built with **React** and **TypeScript**, ensuring a type-safe and maintainable codebase. **Vite** is used as the build tool, providing a fast and efficient development experience. The user interface is styled with **Tailwind CSS**, allowing for rapid and consistent design.
*   **Backend**: The backend is powered by **Supabase**, which provides a suite of tools for authentication, database management, and storage. This choice allows for a streamlined development process, with a focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
*   **Database**: The application uses a **PostgreSQL** database, managed by Supabase. The database schema is defined and managed with **Drizzle ORM**, a TypeScript ORM that provides a type-safe and intuitive way to interact with the database.
*   **Routing and State Management**: **React Router** is used for client-side routing, enabling a smooth and responsive single-page application experience. **Zustand** is employed for state management, offering a lightweight and flexible solution for managing application state.

### Architecture Overview

The project follows a standard client-server architecture, with a clear separation of concerns:

*   **`src/pages`**: Contains the top-level components for each route in the application.
*   **`src/components`**: Houses reusable UI components, organized by feature (e.g., `quiz`, `auth`, `subscription`).
*   **`src/layouts`**: Defines the overall structure of the application's pages (e.g., `MainLayout`, `AuthLayout`).
*   **`src/contexts`**: Manages global state and provides application-wide functionality, such as authentication and toast notifications.
*   **`src/hooks`**: Includes custom React hooks for fetching and managing data (e.g., `useQuizzes`).
*   **`src/lib`**: Contains core logic and third-party integrations, including Supabase client configuration and database service definitions.
*   **`src/db`**: Defines the database schema using Drizzle ORM.
*   **`supabase/migrations`**: Stores the SQL migration files that track changes to the database schema over time.

This structure promotes modularity and maintainability, making it easier to scale the application and add new features in the future.
### Configuration Notes

*   **Password Reset**: To ensure password reset emails contain the correct link, the **Site URL** in your Supabase project's **Authentication -> General** settings must be set to your production domain (e.g., `https://your-app.com`). This is because the reset email is generated by the Supabase backend and requires the production URL to be explicitly configured.
